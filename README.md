## Data Visualization and Modeling of the Kelp Forest Monitoring Data collected by Channel Islands National Park
This is my second attempt at designing a shiny web application for the KFMP at Channel Islands National Park (CINP). This tool is designed to do exploratory data analysis through interactive data visualization and statistical modeling.

A working example of this app can be found at [Cloud Run App](https://app-4oc2gi4bqq-uw.a.run.app/) or [GKE Cluster](http://34.94.133.101/). I am currently working on finding the best/fastest/cheapest solution to hosting this in the cloud and these are my first two attempts. The Cloud Run service is updated regularly (whenever commits are pushed to github) while the GKE Cluster is not so there will be differences between the two.
