# **Kelp Forest Ecology at California's Channel Islands** 

## Data Visualization and Exploration Application

This web application is to be used for data exploration and visualization purposes only. The raw data has been checked and certified by the resident subtidal marine ecologist for Channel Islands National Park. The summary tables used for many of the visualizations were produced independently and have not yet been peer reviewed or verified for accuracy. The graphics produced here are not intended for publication and everything shown here is assumed to be suspect without further analysis. For official data requests, please submit an application [(here)](https://irma.nps.gov/RPRS/) or contact Channel Islands National Park's marine ecologist [(here)](https://www.nps.gov/im/medn/kelp-forest-communities.htm) with further questions. Ecological data has been provided by the Kelp Forest Monitoring Program. Other data is provided by NOAA and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography.

This application is under development and as such many of the features are incomplete. If you click on something and recieve an error message that is likely a placeholder for something to come in the future. Many tabs are incomplete compared to what has been invisioned for them. Some features and the layout are intended to be useful for writing field notes while others are aimed more towards education programs for classrooms. I am in the stage of trying many differnt Shiny features to see what I like and what works well.
