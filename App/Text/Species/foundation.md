### What is a foundation species?

Foundation species are the species in an ecosystem which play an important role in structuring the community. These species can occur at any trophic level and generally consist of a mix of autotrophs (primary producers) and heterotrophs (consumers). These species tend to have a disproportionate effect on the abundance of other species and so have a strong influence on the structure of the community. This leads to a handful of species being largely responsible for the diversity of species in an ecosystem.

The kelp forests off the coast of California consist of several important foundation species. This section looks at the roles of these species and how they effect the communities at the Channel Islands.
