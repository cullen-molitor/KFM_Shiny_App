## Choosing Indicator Species

Specific kelp forest plants and animals were selected for monitoring from a list of nearly 1,000 species compiled by Dr. John M. Engle of the Tatman Foundation. The list was derived from scientific literature and data collected during a series of Tatman Foundation supported cruises in the Channel Islands while Dr. Engle was working for the University of Southern California Catalina Marine Science Center. The primary objective in selecting taxa for monitoring was to provide a representative cross section of the ecological roles present in the park kelp forests. These taxa serve as ecological "vital signs" of system health. To fulfill this objective, selected species needed to include representatives of all trophic levels, a variety of reproductive strategies, both sessile and mobile organisms, and variety of feeding strategies

Six criteria were used to select species from the list. Species were selected that were: 

  1.	specifically mentioned in the park's enabling legislation or protected by law (e.g. threatened or endangered)

  2.	legally harvested

  3.	exceptionally common or characteristic of entire communities

  4.	alien to the park/invasive species

  5.	endemic to the park, or extremely limited in distribution

  6.	well known or "charismatic"

Using these criteria, 15 algae, 38 invertebrate and 15 fish taxa were originally selected for long-term monitoring. Since its conception, the list of taxa has been modified through the process of statistical and peer reviews (Davis et. al, 1996. Rassweiler 2016). Some taxa have been removed from the list while others have been added. Changes to the original list of taxa have been minor to maintain consistency of year to year data comparisons. There are currently 16 algae or groups of algae, 41 invertebrates, and all identifiable fish (113 species as of 2011) taxa monitored (Appendix A). The changes to the original list of taxa are discussed in the data history section of this handbook.

The monitored species are characteristic of kelp forests throughout the park. They represent both boreal and temperate biogeographical provinces and species whose centers of abundance fall within the transition zone. Some species, such as giant kelp, *Macrocystis pyrifera*, and red sea urchins, *Strongylocentrotus franciscanus*, are ubiquitous in the park. Other species, such as the California hydrocoral, *Stylaster (Allopora) californicus*, are found only at a few isolated sites. Some species are extremely abundant like the purple sea urchin, *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*, whereas others like the giant-spined sea star, *Pisaster giganteus*, are widespread in distribution but generally occur in low densities. Many of the selected species are long-lived, with life spans of 10 to more than 50 years, thus their abundance provides a stable measure of conditions in kelp forests that is relatively insulated from annual fluctuations. At the same time, annual recruitment and reproductive efforts of some populations provide measurements of year-to-year fluctuations that augment observations of short-lived species. For example, the abundance of the blue-banded goby, *Lythrypnus dalli*, depends heavily on local environmental conditions.  

The combination of organisms provides mechanisms for detecting both short and long-term variations in kelp forests. The monitored species also represent a wide array of trophic levels, from primary producers and obligate herbivores to high level predators and detritivores. In addition, the organisms demonstrate feeding techniques ranging from sessile filter feeders and sedentary grazers to highly mobile planktivorous fishes and wide-ranging benthic foragers. Reproductive strategies of these species run the gamut from live births seen in surf perches, to the precarious release of gametes into the sea by abalone and urchins, to the long-lived pelagic larvae of the California spiny lobster, *Panulirus interruptus*. The selected array of species provides many opportunities to monitor the health of kelp forests and potentially to detect the facets of human impact, extending from pollution to habitat disturbance and direct removal.
