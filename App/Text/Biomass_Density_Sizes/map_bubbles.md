## Plot Notes

These maps show the relative biomass or density of a species by the size of the bubbles plotted over the geogrphic location of each site.

This allows a user to look for spatial differences in the relative biomass or density in a more intuitive way when compared to spaghetti lines on a traditional line plot. 

These plots are more of a proof of concept and are still a work in progress. 

A user can select an island and a species with either a single year or the plot can be animated over time.
