## Plot Notes

In 2003, 4 sites become protected by State Marine Reserves

-   Hare Rock, San Miguel Island, Gull Island South, Santa Cruz Island, Scorpion Anchorage, Santa Cruz Island, SE Sea Lion Rookery, Santa Barbara Island,

-   These sites will show a s a dotted line up to 2002, followed by a break, and continue as a solid line starting in 2003

The x axis is labeled with survey year, though the points plotted are by survey date

-   This means the points will show up slightly to the right of the axis grid marks

-   Most sites are surveyed on unique days, and some are surveyed over more than one day. The latest survey date for each site within a year is used for simplicity

The y axis scale is set to "free" by default. This means that each island grouping will have a unique axis scale to show intra-island differences.

-   This can be changed to "fixed" which will show inter-island differences.

The lines are set to "smooth" by default. This means that the lines use locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS)

-   This smoothing is meant to better represent the long term trends by eliminating the sharp peaks and valleys seen in the inter-year differences

-   To see the true data summaries, you can set the line type to "sharp" for "all sites" and for "individual site"

The "original 16 sites" data summary shows a pseudo-BACI (Before After Control Impact) analysis in the top panel.

-   It is important to note that there are only two sites that have been in reserves since 1978 and both are on Anacapa Island

-   In 2003, the size of the Anacapa Island SMR was expanded from 15 acres to about 11,000 acres

-   See first plot note to see which sites make up the before after group

-   the remaining 10 sites make up the control group

-   This plot does not account for abiotic factors like water temperature, ocean currents, or wave exposure
