## Plot Notes

These ratios compare biomass or density values inside marine reserves to those outside

-   There are two sites that have been in reserves since monitoring began and both are on Anacapa Island. Until 2003, it is these two sites compared to 14 sites

-   In 2003, 4 sites become protected by State Marine Reserves. 2003 and 2004 represent 6 sites inside, compared to the remaining 10

-   2005 on represents 14 sites inside SMRs compared to 18 sites outside (Keyhole, Anacapa Island is excluded due to being inside a SMCA)

-   In 2003, the size of the Anacapa Island SMR was expanded from 15 acres to about 11,000 acres

-   Full monitoring of Miracle Mile was not done until 2005, and is therefore excluded from 2001-2004

The y axis scale is log<sub>10</sub> transformed to show differences in orders of magnitude

-   This also makes the plots more reasonable for the years with few observations inside or outside a reserve where the ratio gets very large or very small

Bars represent 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated from bootstrapped sampling distributions. 

-   Bars which are capped with a crossbar at the tips show the end of the CI. Those without the crossbar go beyond the graph edge and are cut from view on purpose. This is because some CI's have a very large range, usually due to few observations.
