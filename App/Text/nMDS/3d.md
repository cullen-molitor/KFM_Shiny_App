## 3 Dimensional Similarity

Plotting the distance matrix created by the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) in three dimensions. This analysis uses non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) to visualize how similar various sites are over time. This is further animated by seeing how these sites change from year to year.
