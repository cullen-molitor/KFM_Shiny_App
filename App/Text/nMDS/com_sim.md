### California Biogeogrpahy 

The Channel Islands sit offshore from a junction which divides two major biogeographic provinces, the cold-temperate Oregonian and the warm-temperate Californian. Point Conception divides these provinces, with the Oregonian to the north and the Californian to the south. From Point Conception going south the shoreline takes a dramatic turn eastwards, providing shelter from the prevailing northwestern storms. The Channel Islands further shelter the coastline from western swells and wind, creating relatively calm and stable coastal conditions much of the year. The region south of Point Conception is known as the Southern California Bight (a bight is a curve or recess in a coastline, river, or other geographical feature). Inside the bight, there is a large gyre which keep the coastal waters warmer than compared to the coastline north of Point Conception. This divide creates two distinct ecological communities:

+ a community of cold-water species to the north 

+ a community of warm-water species to the south  

### Channel Islands Biogeogrpahy

The Channel Islands mirror this transition from cold water to warm water and also have distinct communities at both island grouping. The island groups consist of San Miguel and Santa Rosa representing the cold-water regime, with Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and Santa Barbara representing the warm-water regime. 

### Marine Protections

The Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) of 1997 established a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in California. There are varying degrees of protection but the majority fall into one of two types:

+ State Marine Reserves (SMRs) which prohibit harvesting any resources in the designated area

+ State Marine Conservation Areas (SMCAs) which allow fisherman to harvest only certain species in the designated area

Channel Islands National Park includes five islands and the waters extending one mile from shore. 20% of those waters are protected by eleven MPAs. Nine of those are designated as no-take SMR, with the remaining two designated SMCA. The KFM program has at least one site inside six of the nine SMRs and in one of the two SMCAs. Four SMRs at four islands have three monitoring sites inside and three sites adjacent to the reserve in order to more closely monitor the effects that marine protections have on the ecological community.   

### Fished Areas

The distance from fishing ports play an important role in how the Channel Islands are fished. 

The weather and seasonality of the islands... areas exposed to rough conditions... 

# Measuring Community Similarity

To identify the differences and similarities of the communities discussed above, we apply a statistical method known as non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS). This method calculates a ranked dissimilarity matrix... AKA a distance matrix... ANOSIM... Ask tim for help nailing down this section lol...

What the graphical axis mean... shapes representing reserve status, color representing either reserve or island groupings...
