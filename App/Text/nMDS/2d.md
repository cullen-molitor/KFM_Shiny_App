## 2 Dimensional Similarity

Plotting the distance matrix created by the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) in two dimensions. This graphical depiction of the distance matrix allows us to visualize how similar or different site, island or reserve groupings are. This is further animated by seeing how these groups change from year to year. This animation also allows us to visualize how long various groups take to respond or recover from perturbations such as warm water events, disease events, or the establishment of marine protections. 

Note how the cold-temperate islands characteristic of the Oregonian province tend to be grouped together and also how they end to be distinct from the warm-temperate islands of the Californian province. 

Old Anacapa Island Reserve established in 1978... Landing Cove and Cathedral cove make for a distinct pair...

In 2003, the MLPA established or expanded the MPAs...

In 2005, 16 sites were added to monitor the effects of the Marine Reserves...

The reserve groupings become distinct over time... by 2019, the difference are greatest, and many of the new reserve sites migrate towards the old reserve sites...
