# Roving Diver Fish Count (RDFC)

## Purpose

+ To estimate species diversity and abundance of fishes within the entire transect area (10 m of each side of the 100 m transect line and from bottom to surface).

## Materials

+ underwater roving diver fish count slate and pencils for each diver

+ watch or bottom timer for each diver

+ summary datasheet, for surface use only. (note: common names are used for this protocol)

## Personnel

+ 3-7 SCUBA equipped observers, consisting of at least three expert observers (see below). 

+ Experience Levels: Experience levels are assigned to every observer based on the discretion of the team leader. This information is recorded on the summary sheet with each observer’s name and permanent observer number. An observer should not conduct a RDFC if they do not know all the RDFC indicator species (Table 10).

+ Expert – an observer who can confidently identify and count all species of fish that commonly occur at the Channel Islands. Table xx has a list of all fish species that have been positively identified on the RDFC up to 2011.

+ Intermediate – an observer who can identify and count all indicator species and most non-indicator species of fish, including differentiating between adult and juvenile. An observer is determined to be intermediate based on the discretion of the team leader. 

+ Novice – an observer who can confidently identify all core RDFC indicator species (see Table 10) and estimate the Abundance indexindice on those species. Typically for a Novice we only record the Abundance category, but if the Lead Biologist is confident the Novice can accurately count any of the core RDFC indicator species, the Counts can also be recorded.
Note: Score is recorded for all (Novice, Intermediate and Expert observers) observers.

## Time Required

+ It is essential for this protocol that exactly 30 minutes per observer is used to count fish.

## Methods

The Roving Diver Fish Counts (RDFC) are conducted using from three to seven observers for each site. An expert observer is defined as someone who can confidently identify and accurately count all species of fishes that commonly occur at the Channel Islands and are vetted by existing expert KFM Biologists. Each of the three to seven observers collects replicate data. The observers should be in groups of 2-3, and survey in opposite directions, or staggered so the divers are not all sampling the same location at the same time.

This method produces three indices of fish abundance: a time Score, Abundance and Count of fish.  The Abundance indexindice is based on the Count. During the RDFC, divers gradually swim around the transect line covering the entire transect area in 30 minutes. The sampling area encompasses ten meters on both sides of the line from the bottom to the top of the water column (or top to bottom if RDFC is the first protocol the divers conduct), yielding a total sampling bottom area of 2000 m² (Figure 25). If the diver conducted the visual fish transect first, they can spend the last part of the RDFC surveying under the canopy while conducting a safety stop. Since there is no meter tape placed perpendicular to the transect line, less experienced divers follow the lead diver. Like how visual fish transect observers estimate the dimensions of the area sampled, RDFC observers must estimate the 10-meter distance from the transect tape. If the dive team conducted visual fish transects prior to RDFC, the secchi disk measurement can help the diver team gauuage the 10 m distance from the main transect line. Throughout the fish count, each observer attempts to search in all habitats (i.e. bottom, midwater, under ledges, kelp canopy, etc.). It is best to perform a kelp canopy count either just before descent, at the beginning of the dive, or during ascent if performed 30 minutes before the end of the dive.

Time Score: 

The Score field is a time Score assigned to each fish species that relates to when during the 30-minute count it was observed. More abundant fish will more often be seen sooner than less abundant fish and thus get a higher score. Divers enter the water above the transect and immediately begin to list the species observed while descending towards the bottom. As each species is noted, the name and count are written down on a blank dive slate. Sampling is divided into 5-minute increments and is limited to 30 minutes. After every five minutes has passed, a horizontal line is drawn across the slate under the list of species seen during that five minute increment (Figure 26, Figure 27, Figure 28). If no species were observed during any 5-minute intervals, a horizontal line is drawn anyway to assist with tracking the time intervals.

The Time Score was originally taken from the Great Annual/American Fish Count protocol. In that protocol, counts could be longer than 30 minutes. Since the RDFC is limited to 30 minutes, no Time Scores less than 5 should ever be present. If an observer sees a new species after the 30-minute count is over, this should not be included in the RDFC, but instead written up in the site notes.

Divers need to be active and swim at a moderate pace to cover the full 2000 m² of bottom and above water column area. With the exceptions of sites that have extremely high abundance of fish and complex habitat, the entire site should be searchable within the 30 minutes. The most useful component of the time score is to keep the diver on track with completing a search over the entire transect. For example, if a diver has only completed one side of the transect in 20 minutes, they need to speed up their pace.

Time into the dive: 5 minutes. This diver sees three fish species in the first 5-minute interval: one garibaldi, three kelp bass, and 100 blacksmith. After 5 minutes, a horizontal line is drawn.

Time into the dive: 10 minutes. In the second 5-minute interval, the diver sees 3 new fish species: 56 adult senoritas, a single female sheephead, and a single juvenile treefish. In addition, the diver sees a school of 75 blacksmith and another garibaldi. However, these fish are NOT listed again. Rather, the diver adds to the counts previously written on the slate. So, the garibaldi count increases from 1 to 2 and blacksmith from 100 to 175 total fish.

Time into the dive: 15 minutes. In the third 5-minute interval, the diver sees two new species. First, a single blackeye goby is seen and then a few minutes later 5 more gobies are seen, making the total abundance 6. A school of 10 opaleye is also observed. In addition, the diver sees a large school of senoritas and 2 female CA sheephead. The abundance estimates for these previously recorded species are updated – the fish are NOT listed again. In the fourth 5-minute interval, no new fish were observed but a horizontal line is still drawn to keep track of the 5-minute time increments. Divers continue the procedure for a total of 30 minutes.

In the fourth and subsequent 5-minute intervals, newly observed species are listed. If more individuals of an already noted species are observed, the species is not written again but the count is added to the previous observation of that species. Divers must be sure to only list species once. They continue to record new species and draw a horizontal line at each five-minute interval until 30 minutes have passed. Divers do not count the same fish more than once. Divers should take note of features such as fin or body damage, coloration, size, and even the number of copepods on a fish to recognize individuals.

In addition to listing and counting all identifiable fish, each diver will search for all indicator species (Table 10) and note if they are absent during the RDFC. Novice divers should at minimum be able to correctly identify all indicator species and actively search for them during their dive. This enables staff to assign these species a zero (0) when entering these data in the database indicating that observer was able to identify the fish species, they were actively searched for and they were not observed during their fish count.

Please note that each observer’s data is an individual count and each observer should refrain from pointing out species to other observers. If a diver is unable to identify a fish species, careful notes related to size, shape, color, etc. are taken for possible later identification. Males, females, and juveniles are also counted individually when applicable. 

Typically, the RDFCs will be conducted immediately after the fish transects. During fish transects a secchi disc reading is taken to measure visibility. If fish transects were not performed a secchi disc reading should be taken at the time of the roving diver fish count. All RDFC surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1500 hours unless otherwise noted.

After the count is completed, the divers debrief, and any unusual fish sightings should be discussed and confirmed. All questionable fish identifications are eliminated from the survey. Divers must ask each other if they looked for the indicator species in Table 10. This is done to ensure the observer didn’t forget to record a fish species that was observed but not written on the dive slate.

Immediately following the dive, RDFC data from all observers at each site is transcribed from the slates to one RDFC summary sheet. Fish observed in the first five minute increment are given a Time Score of 10, the second five minute increment are given a score of 9, the third five minute increment score of 8, the fourth five minute increment a score of 7, the fifth five minute increment a score of 6, and the last five minute increment a score of 5. Indicator species that were not present receive a Time Score of 0 if not present during the RDFC. No other fish species get a zero if not present. When providing data to the recorder, divers call out the Time Score first, followed by the tallied count for each species (garibaldi 10, 2; kelp bass 10, 5; blacksmith 10, 175; senorita 9, 206; etc). 

To record RDFC data on the summary sheet correctly, recorders use the guidelines summarized below: 

Novice Observers

For indicator species positively identified, fill in Score and Abundance columns and leave Count column blank.  
Example:      10      C 	

For indicator species NOT observed, only place “---“in the Abundance column and leave Score and Count columns blank. This means the species was looked for but not found.										Example:               ---

Expert and Intermediate Observers  

For indicator species positively identified, fill in Score, Abundance and Count columns.  
Example:       8       F       4
     
For indicator species NOT observed, only fill in Abundance and Count columns and leave Score column blank.  This means the species was looked for but not found.											Example:        	----      0
