# Random Point Contacts (RPCs)

## Purpose

+ To estimate substrate composition and percent cover of selected algal and invertebrate taxa.

## Materials

+ random point contact (RPC) bar:  a 1.5 m rebar-filled PVC rod with 2 strings attached, each 

+ string with 5 knots. The strings are 1.8 m long and 1.2 m long. The long string attaches to the ends of the bar and the short string attaches 25 
cm from each end. Knots are at least 20 cm apart and are colored with a bright red or orange marker

+ set of surface-supplied diving equipment:  Diver Control System (DCS or KMAC), Aga/Guardian mask, umbilical and pony bottle unit

+ set of RPC datasheets 

+ clipboard and pencils

+ underwater species list reference card for diver (optional)

## Personnel

+ console operator/data recorder

+ line tender and backup diver (as appropriate based on surface supplied dive regulations)

+ surface supply diver experienced in the identification and search image needed for species listed in Table 8.
 
## Time Required

+ Five to fifteen minutes are required for each meter number along the line (75-225 minutes total). Familiarity with the organism list, a console operator/data recorder who is adept at scoring datasheets, and areas with few canopy species will decrease bottom time. Inexperience, heavy surge, and a dense canopy will increase bottom time and a deeper site will often require more than one diver to complete a site. It is important for the diver to monitor and report depth and bottom time frequently to the console operator during the dive.

## Methods

The diver will sample 40 points from each of the 15 systematic points (meter #) with a random start along the main transect.  At the start of each field season a new sampling point must be randomly selected. The initial sampling point (a number between 0-6) is chosen using a random number generator. That number will be the meter number that the first set of 40 points is taken from. The subsequent sampling points along the line are at 6.67 m intervals rounded to the nearest whole number (0 m, 7 m, 13 m, 20 m, 27 m, etc).  Each sampling point is recorded consecutively on the top of the datasheets corresponding to quadrat 1,2,3 etc. This systematic set of numbers with a random start will be the same at all sites sampled throughout a field season.

Console operator and recorder (dive tender): Once the diver is in the water, the dive tender/data recorder is responsible for telling the diver the meter numbers to be sampled along the transect. As the diver identifies the organisms, algae, and substrate under each point, the data recorder marks these as tick marks on the datasheet. Each sampling point (meter #) along the transect line has four columns on the datasheet. Each column corresponds to the observations taken for two strings on one side of the RPC bar (Figure 23). Each column should have 10 substrate points. Therefore, each point (meter #) along the transect line should have a total of 40 substrate points. The total number of substrate points are counted to double-check for missed or double-counted points.

The dive tender/data recorder monitors SCUBA tank pressure and the diver’s air pressure in the umbilical hose. Tanks should be replaced with a minimum of 500 PSI remaining to allow enough reserve air if there is any issue that needs to be resolved in swapping tanks. Also, it is the responsibility of the dive tender/data recorder to remind the diver to check their pony bottle pressure and bottom time remaining throughout the dive. It is important for both the tender and the diver to be aware of the diver’s depth and bottom time (especially at deeper sites), so the tender should periodically ask the diver for their depth and bottom time. Especially when nearing the end of the dive.

Line Tender: The line tender aids in feeding out the umbilical hose so that the diver can reach the first sampling point, and then helps recoil the hose as the diver moves back towards the vessel. The tender will also assist in helping to change tanks and record data if need be. Also, the line tender must be on stand-by to dive in case an emergency arises with the diver.

Diver: The diver carries the RPC bar and during descent, locates the transect line, then proceeds to the first random sampling point. The RPC bar is placed perpendicular to the transect line (Figure 23), held in place with the string stretched taut at each knot perpendicular to the RPC bar. The diver visualizes an imaginary line running vertically through the knot up to one meter above the substratum. They relay to the console operator/recorder all layers of organisms that intersect this imaginary line. Attached (e.g. epibionts such as spirorbid worms), or sessile, organisms are recorded as “miscellaneous invertebrates”, unless specifically listed on the datasheet. Motile invertebrates are not counted (except for Ophiothrix spiculata and Pachythyone rubra **) but are instead moved to determine what is underneath. Indicator species are only counted once per point even if encountered multiple times (e.g. encrusting bryozoans on a kelp blade but then also on the rocky substrate below shall only be called off once). Divers do not distinguish between juvenile, subadult, or adult phases for organisms surveyed on RPC.
Divers identify all organisms under the knots on both strings on one side of the bar (Figure 23), giving a total of ten points (Count A). They move the string to the opposite side of the bar (Count B) for another 10 points. Next, the RPC bar is placed on the opposite side of the transect line and the process is repeated (Counts C and D). As the diver moves, they communicate with the console operator with comments like: “next ten” and “other side of the line" and “last ten”. These phrases will assist the dive tender to ensure that the proper number of points are recorded in the correct column on the datasheet.

The type substrate is also named at each knot, where: “sand” is sediment that one can push a finger into without hitting rock, “cobble” is rock easily moved by a diver, and “rock” is immovable substrate. “Bare” is used when the substrate is devoid of any apparent living organisms and can be used in combination with any substrate type.
