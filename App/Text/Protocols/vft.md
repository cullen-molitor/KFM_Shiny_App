# Visual Fish Transects

+ Note: Visual Fish Transects and Video-taped Transects (see Video-taped transects protocol) are conducted by the same dive buddy team. However, these are two separate methodologies with completely different purposes.  

## Purpose

+ To determine the abundance of selected fish species along the 100 m transect line.

## Materials

+ dive slate with pencil

+ underwater visual fish transect datasheet (common names are used for this protocol)

+ 30 m tape with secchi disk attached

+ surge meter

## Personnel

+ 2 SCUBA equipped observers; one diver trained in methodology, identification and search image for fish (Table 9). The other diver experienced in conducting video-taped transects.

## Time Required

+ 15-20 minutes are required for fish transects.

## Methods

+ Note: To limit altering fish behavior, no other divers shall be in the water other than the fish and video transect divers when these protocols are conducted. 

The diver swims along one side of the 100 m transect line counting and recording all the indicator fish species present within a 3 m tall x 2 m wide x 50 m long area in front of the video-tape diver. The diver will record any fish within this area as far out as they can see along the 50 m dimension. Each site is divided into four 50 m transects. Each transect should be swam in 2.5 minutes. The diver will count the total number of fish per 50 m transect, using the snapshot method, and record that number in the appropriate column on the datasheet. The snapshot method is defined as counting a static volume of fish. The diver should only count fish observed in the transect and not count fish that swim in/through the area after having counted all fish within the transect. Counts are differentiated by species and by age class (adults or juveniles, with juveniles usually defined as less than 10 cm in length). After the first transect is completed, the diver checks the time to see if they are swimming at a pace of 2.5 minutes/50 m transect. If not, swimming speed is adjusted accordingly. After completing the first two transects (100 m end), the diver should swim about 5 m beyond the end of the line before turning around to begin the next count. This procedure allows fish that often follow the divers to diffuse off the line before the start of the third transect. During this protocol, a second diver will be performing video transects (see next protocol) near the fish observer. It is both divers’ responsibility to keep track of each other along the transect line.

After the four fish transects have been completed, visibility and surge are measured with the help of the second diver. Visibility is measured horizontally near the bottom with a 20 cm secchi disk. The secchi disk is always oriented to face the sun (i.e. to the east in the morning and to the west in the afternoon). One diver holds the secchi disk in place while kneeling on the bottom (Secchi is approximately 1.3 meters off bottom), while the other diver holds the measuring tape and swims away (towards the sun) from the secchi disk. When the secchi disk just disappears, the diver with the reel notes the distance and then begins to rewind the tape noting the distance the secchi disc reappears. Visibility is recorded as the mean of the two distances. Surge is measured with a diver-held surge meter (Barlotti, 1980; Foster et al., 1985) and is recorded as the maximum degrees of movement of a #6 cork on a 30 cm long string attached to a protractor and placed parallel to the surge direction. Immediately following the dive, on the surface, observers should check datasheets to be sure all numbers are legible and totals for each species are accurate. Datasheets are rinsed in fresh water, allowed to air dry, and stored in the completed datasheet notebook. Fish transects are conducted once or twice per summer at each site, as time allows, with a minimum of two weeks between sampling events.

## Training Required

New divers conducting fish transects must be trained. Training includes conducting fish transects as described above with an experienced observer and comparing datasheets at the end of the dive (trainer and trainee are counting fish on the same side of the transect). When the project leader is convinced that the new observer can perform fish counts accurately the new observer’s data will be included in the database (as observer B). This training may take several dives or an entire summer depending on the experience of the diver in training. It is possible that some divers may not be qualified to conduct this protocol.
