## Sampling Technique Selection

The great diversity of organisms and the physical habitats associated with kelp forests require carefully selected sampling approaches to effectively monitor species population dynamics. Accuracy (the closeness of a measure value to its true value) and precision (the closeness of repeated measurements of the same quantity) are two important attributes to good field sampling used in long-term monitoring programs. The ability to sample several target species at once is also an essential skill for sampling in a dynamic kelp forest environment. 

Finally, sampling techniques for this monitoring program must provide values relatively free of variation among observers and must not significantly affect populations of organisms being monitored or alter their environment.
     
At the time of this publication, the technology for remote sensing or sampling of kelp forest organisms from the sea surface is neither accurate nor precise enough to monitor population dynamics of key species. Development of diving equipment has spawned an array of in situ sampling techniques that have potential for providing accurate and precise measures of population abundance, distribution, age structure, reproduction, recruitment, growth rate, mortality rate, sex composition, phenology of kelp forest organisms, and oceanographic and videographic equipment that yields permanent records.
     
In January 1982, a workshop to review potential sampling techniques was held at the Marine Science Institute, UCSB. Thirty-seven scientists participated in the two-day workshop. Sampling techniques for kelp forest organisms were evaluated using the following criteria:

+ ability to sample target species accurately and precisely

+ impacts on target and other species

+ efficiency (cost effectiveness)

+ ability to create permanent records of samples for confirmation and future analysis

+ requirements for highly trained observers or extremely complex procedures or equipment

Permanent transects were used to reduce within-site variability and provide precise measurements of population dynamics where the major variable is time. Each transect of 12-mm diameter lead-filled woven nylon line was permanently affixed to the bedrock with stainless steel eyebolts positioned about every 10 meters along the transect (a detailed description on transect installation is found in the Data History Section). The permanent transects are relocated each time with GPS coordinates. The transects provide a reference for divers and for sample plot orientation which facilitates data collection during the limited bottom time available to divers.

Revisions of the original sampling techniques have been implemented prior to and following a review workshop held in 1995 (Davis et.al., 1996). The most current sampling techniques used are described in this Handbook. Changes in protocols are documented in the Data Management and Data History section of this Handbook.
