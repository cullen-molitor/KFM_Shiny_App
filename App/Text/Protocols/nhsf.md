# Natural Habitat Size Frequencies

## Purpose

+ To estimate population age structure to identify and monitor recruitment cohorts.

## Materials

+ 6 stainless steel vernier calipers, 220 mm.  Larger calipers can be used for Haliotis spp.

+ 6 dive slates

+ 2 metal 1-meter or ½-meter sticks, to measure gorgonian/hydrocoral widths.

+ 4 large mesh collection bags

+ Natural Habitat Size Frequency datasheets (as many as needed)

+ 1-2 underwater datasheets for each species of gorgonians/hydrocoral

+ 2 underwater datasheets for Macrocystis pyrifera

## Personnel

+ Up to six SCUBA divers experienced in the identification and search image needed for species listed in Table 12.

## Time Required

+ Depending on distribution, abundance, sampling may take between 30-100 minutes for each species. Often, an experienced diver will be tasked with measuring multiple species or protocols.

## Methods 

+ Note: no invasive sampling (turning over rocks) is conducted in any KFM methodology, with the exception that sea urchins are removed from crevices to locate and measure smaller sea urchins underneath the spine canopy.  

It is very important in sampling for size frequency distributions that all individuals in the target population are represented in proportion to their relative abundance in the population. To reduce bias, every individual of the target species present in the study plot must be located and measured until at least the minimum sample size is encountered.  In some cases, there may be less than the prescribed sample size (Table 12) at a site in which case all individuals present are measured. Divers note the number that were found and if the entire transect was searched on their datasheet as well as in the notes for that day. Divers search the area along the fixed transect line using a band transect type search method to limit their search to a specific area. 

During this method, a diver performs a swath over an area of approximately 5-10 m by 2 arm-lengths while swimming parallel or perpendicular to the main transect. These swaths are evenly spaced along the main transect to gather a representative sample from the entire 100 m transect line. For example, three swaths may be made: one at the 0 m end, one at the 100 m end, and one around the 50 m mark. The spacing and number of swaths made will depend on the abundance and sample size of the target species, therefore this decision is at the discretion of the diver. For example, some species that are highly aggregated such as Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sample size is a minimum of 200), divers should measure approximately 1/3 (~67 S. purpuratus) from three areas, taking care to measure the first ~67 they encounter from each area.  At the divers’ judgement, these areas should be roughly evenly dispersed along the transect such as at the 0, 50 and 100 m or 20, 50 and 80 m. 

In cases where there are relatively low densities of the target species, the diver can conduct one long swath along the main transect line using their arms or a 1.5 m band transect bar for reference. In cases where densities are very high, divers can use 0.5 or 1.0 m² quadrats to focus their search effort. Though in nearly all cases the band transect type of swath will be used to locate organisms for measure, the chief scientist may instruct divers in what search method to use. Pairs of divers are often assigned multiple species to measure during a dive to maximize efficiency, with each diver concentrating on one side or a separate area of the transect while being able to keep in contact with their dive partner. 

Where very experienced divers are available and if they can task load, many of these size frequencies can be conducted while doing band transects. While this slows down band transects, it often adds overall efficiency for measuring the indicator species that are present, as the observer is already searching for them. However, it also adds a level of complexity/task loading and program leads, and divers need to be able to assess that this task loading does not compromise safety and data in any way. In addition, divers often will conduct size frequencies for abalone during band transects, and where abalone are rare, the divers are instructed to look between band transects to locate abalone so that we can ensure the entire transect was searched for these important species. This in addition to the density data from band transects can give us a density proxy for the entire transect area, 2000 m2. When this is conducted, this information should be on the size frequency datasheet as well as the site notes.

Divers must be aware of whether 1 m quadrats or band transects are being conducted and where. Indicator species cannot be measured in the same location that they have yet to be sampled on the density protocols. This prevents the indicator species from being moved around. Therefore, urchins and sea star indicator species should not be measured within 1 m of the transect line until quadrats have been completed. Also, Lythechinus anamesus cannot be measured until band transects have been completed.

Macrocystis pyrifera is measured along the entire length of the main transect to ensure a representative sample. Do not sample all M. pyrifera from half of the transect. If there are few M. pyrifera present, the entire site is sampled to attempt to sample 150 individuals. The area sampled varies depending on plant density but can extend out to 10 m from the transect line. The number of stipes one meter above the bottom are counted. These data are recorded on underwater datasheets.

Width for gorgonians and Stylaster californica are measured to the nearest centimeter; all other invertebrate measurements are made to the nearest millimeter. Measurements are made in situ with minimal disturbance to the organisms, except for sea urchins which can be removed (if possible) to check under the spine canopy of large adults for juveniles. Divers should ensure they know how to identify juvenile sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus have orange colored tube feet and S. purpuratus have clear/white tube feet). If time is limited and densities are high, sea urchins can be collected in mesh bags, measured on board the research vessel, and returned to the point of collection. The minimum sample sizes and types of measurements for each species are indicated below.
Except for gorgonians, Stylaster californica, and Macrocystis pyrifera (which have separate underwater datasheets), measurements taken underwater are written on a dive slate and then transcribed to a natural habitat size frequency datasheet. One datasheet is used for each diver at each site, and multiple species may be placed on the same datasheet using the corresponding letter listed for each species at the top.

At sites where Haliotis spp. are present, band transect divers should also search between bands to measure all present at the site. This is an effective way to thoroughly search the entire site since the 10 m tape reeled perpendicular to the main transect line is used as a reference. The number measured can then serve as a proxy for abundance. When this is performed in a thorough manner, it should be noted in the site summary notes. 
Since Haliotis spp. have become rare at most sites and small live Haliotis spp. are difficult to locate for measurement due to their cryptic nature, shells are measured. If possible, all Haliotis spp. shells at a site are collected during regular monitoring activities, brought to the surface, identified, and measured. Data is entered on a shell size frequency datasheet, and noted as either F for a fresh shell (new fresh shiny nacreous layer with no growth on the inside of the shell) or O for an old shell (growth on the inside or dull nacreous layer). Old or Fresh shells can sometimes be difficult to differentiate without considerable experience, so it is always good to have a consensus on this or defer to someone who has had considerable experience in determining these categories. Once shells have been measured, they should be disposed of off the site. 
Since there are no live emergent Haliotis spp. at many of the sites, the data collected on shells could be the first indication that these populations may or may not be recovering.
