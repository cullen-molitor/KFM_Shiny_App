# Fish Size Frequency

## Purpose

+ To estimate fish population size structure.

## Materials

+ fish slate with 40 cm etched marks along top edge (Figure 29)

+ fish size frequency summary sheet (common names are used for this protocol)

## Personnel

A minimum of one SCUBA equipped observer who has been trained in underwater fish size frequencies. If only one trained observer is available, this observer’s buddy can conduct RDFCs, as both divers will be covering the same area within the same time frame. In the past, some very experienced observers have been able to adequately complete RDFC and fish size frequency surveys simultaneously. However, this takes a high level of skill and shall not be conducted if the observer feels their data is compromised by combining tasks.

## Time Required

+ A minimum of 30 minutes per observer is required to measure fish. 

## Methods

This method is performed during or after the RDFC in accordance with the RDFC protocol with a minimum sampling time of 30 minutes. However, the priority is to measure all the fish in the sampling area or at least have a high enough sample size to represent the size structure at the site. The time it takes to do this may vary with diver as a function of experience. As with the RDFC, the observer samples as much of the 2000 m² area (ten meters on either side of the 100 m permanent transect line) as possible (see Figure 25). Within this area and time, as many fish as possible are sized of all species, however the species in Table 11 are listed with a priority number if there are so many fish that not all can be measured. At the discretion of the chief scientist onboard, fish encountered after fish size frequency measurements were conducted may be added to the data summary sheet if they are certain it was missed during the 30-minute survey. This addition mostly occurs with sessile cryptic fish such as cabezon or lingcod. The observers for this protocol must be trained, tested and able to accurately estimate fish sizes underwater. Training procedures for this protocol can be found in the Fish Size Frequency Training Protocol. The observer should be proficient in sizing fish to within 20% of the actual total length (TL).

Observers estimate TL (see Figure 4) of small fish (<15 cm TL) to the nearest centimeter and larger fish (>15 cm) within 20%, for example plus or minus 1.5 cm for a 15 cm fish, 2 cm for a 20 cm fish, etc. All observed species names and sizes are recorded on a blank dive slate, or a waterproof datasheet pre-filled with common fish species can be used. In the case where there are relatively high densities of certain species (e.g. blacksmith), a size range measurement for the entire school is recorded in parentheses followed by a count (Figure 29) or the school can be broken up into different size classes if different cohorts/size ranges are in the same school. If gender is visually distinguishable (e.g. California sheephead and rock wrasse) individuals are kept separate and recorded as well. Like the RDFC method, each observer attempts to search all habitats (i.e. bottom, midwater, under ledges, water column, canopy, etc.); however, cryptic species are not measured (see organisms sampled section below). In addition, due to limited time and the increased importance of measuring some fish, observers should concentrate their efforts on the species in Table 11 if they are unable to measure all the fish at a site (see below).

A minimum of 30 minutes is required to cover a site and collect adequate sample size of indicator species present. More time can be used if necessary, to acquire a larger sample size, like size frequency measurements of invertebrates and Macrocystis pyrifera.

Upon completion of the dive, each observer reviews and tallies all totals for each size category per species. On the surface and as soon as possible with the assistance of a recorder, the observer transfers the information from the dive slate to a fish size frequency summary datasheet (Figure 30). This procedure is repeated for each observer on the same datasheet. The summary datasheets are then stored and from these sheets, the data are entered into the database after the cruise. 

## Organisms Sampled

No cryptic species should be measured for size (e.g. island kelpfish, Gibbonsia spp., black-eye goby, sculpins, blue-banded goby and zebra goby, etc.). Schooling baitfish such as sardines, anchovies and smelt are also not sized. All other species are measured. However, those listed in Table 11 get prioritization if not enough time allows for the measurement of all species at a site. Typically, a well-trained experienced observer can measure all fish of these species at a site in 30 minutes.
