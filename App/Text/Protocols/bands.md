# Band Transects

## Purpose

+ To determine abundance and distribution of rare and clumped organisms not adequately sampled by quadrats.

## Materials

+ 2 dive slates with pencils

+ 2 1.5 meter PVC rods

+ 2 10 m or longer transect tapes w/carabiners. Transect tape reel are preferably weighted.

+ 2 underwater band transect datasheets 

## Personnel

+ 2 SCUBA equipped observers experienced in the identification and search image needed for species listed in Table 7.

## Time Required

+ Typically, 100 to 150 minutes is required for sampling. Sampling time is decreased for flat, low relief habitats. Sampling time will increase at high relief, high cover areas. In addition, areas with large densities of Lytechinus anamesus, white sea urchin, will significantly slow sampling.

## Methods

+ Note: no invasive sampling (turning over rocks) is conducted in any KFM methodology, with the exception that sea urchins are removed from crevices to locate and measure smaller sea urchins underneath the spine canopy.  

Divers sample twelve points along the transect line. The points are systematic with a random starting point.  At the start of each field season new sampling points must be randomly selected. The initial sampling point (a number between 0-7) is chosen using a random number generator. That number will be the meter mark for the first band transect placement. The subsequent sampling points along the line are at 8.33 m intervals rounded to the nearest whole number (8 m, 17 m, 25 m, 33 m, etc). Each sampling point is recorded consecutively on the top of the datasheets corresponding to quadrat 1,2,3 etc. This systematic set of numbers with a random start will be the same for all sites sampled throughout a field season. However, these numbers are selected independently from the random meter numbers selected for 1 m quadrats.

Divers attach a meter tape to the lead line near each sampling point with a carabiner. Then, divers swim out 10 m in opposite directions as their dive partner, perpendicular to the 100 m transect (Figure 22). Next, divers drop and secure the tape reels to the bottom and swim back towards the transect line along one side of the 10 m tape while using the 1.5 m PVC rod to determine the width of the transect and count the organisms listed on the datasheet that occur within that area. Once the lead line is reached, divers work back towards the reel along the opposite side of the tape, counting target organisms within 1.5 m of the tape. Once the reel is reached, they wind up the tape and move to the next subsequent meter number along the 100 m transect line, making sure to search the habitat thoroughly, including cracks, and crevices. However, they do not conduct any invasive sampling (i.e. do not turn over rocks). At the beginning, midpoint and end of each transect divers should make sure they have good contact with their dive partner. If conditions are so surgy that the meter tape is moving significantly, divers can stabilize the tape by wrapping it around a holdfast or securing on/in the substrate.  
 
After returning to the surface, divers check their datasheet and their partner’s datasheet for readability and outliers. The datasheets are rinsed in fresh water, air dried, and stored in the completed datasheet notebook. 

On each transect, each diver covers an area of 3 m x 10 m. Adjacent segments are added (Count A and Count B) from both divers to produce a sampled area of 3 m x 20 m at each of the 12 points. 

At the bottom of Table 7 is a list of “write-in” species. These species are very rare and are not listed on the datasheet since there is not enough room to include a row for each of them. If one is observed on band transects it can be written into the blank row at the bottom of the datasheet. For example, all rare abalone species, such as H. sorenseni, should be counted on band transects if observed.
