### General

The design of this ecological monitoring program was supported by the National Park Service in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Game, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s National Marine Sanctuary Program. More than 430 scientists, resource managers and boat captains from many academic institutions and resource management agencies participated in this endeavor. Of particular note were the sustained efforts of G. E. Davis, D. V. Richards, J. M Morgan, J. E. Mondragon, D. Lerma, M. D. Moss, K. J. Moore, J. M. Engle, M. D. Conlin, T. J. Herrlinger, T. W. Anderson, J. D. Lewis, D. C. Canestro, S. L. Kim, D. Forcucci, and J. W. Trone. Their broad experience greatly strengthened the experimental design and resulting monitoring protocols.
