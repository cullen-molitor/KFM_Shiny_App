# Leaflet Maps

Leaflet is an open source and interactive maps platform. By default, there are several layers selected which display information about sites. These include site markers, buoys, boundaries, transects, and transect endpoints. For a simplified map, these layers can be deselected in the drop-down menu found in the upper right hand corner of the map. Similarly, the base map can be changed from the default ocean base tiles to several other tile providers including satellite imagery. 

The default map level does not provide the maximum level of zoom. To achieve a closer look at sites please select any other base map tiles.

This map also offers a measurement feature found in the lower left hand corner. This will allow a user to measure the distance between two point or to calculate the area of polygons. 

For more detailed satellite imagery, the static imagery tab provides higher resolution images with many of the same layers.
