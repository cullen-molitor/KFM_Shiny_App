# GPS Transects

So far 30 of the 33 active KFM sites have been mapped with GPS across the length of the transect. The three missing sites are:

1. Wyckoff Ledge on San Miguel Island

2. Rodes Reef on Santa Rosa Island

3. Admiral's Reef on Anacapa Island

For these site, only a blue dot will be displayed near the middle of the transect area. 

The GPS transects are done by a snorkeler on the surface following the bubble trails or line of sight to the diver on the bottom who swims along the length of the transect. These transects are what you see plotted above. The 0 m end and the 100 m end indicate the direction and extreme ends of the transect. GPS transects have taken years to do, and are still not complete due to the need for calm conditions, preferably with good visibility, no current, and little to no swell. It also helps when someone remembers to load the GPS unit before the trip. 

Note to self: Update maps with onshore/offshore text.
