# San Miguel Island 

Of the Channel Islands, San Miguel Island is the furthest north and the furthest west. This island is by far the most extreme in terms of weather, ocean conditions, water temperature, and distance from mainland ports. It is one of the least visited and most wild of the islands.

This island is best represented by the cold-temperate kelp forest communities found in the Oregonian biogeographic province...
