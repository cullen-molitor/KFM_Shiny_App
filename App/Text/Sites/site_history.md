### Biogeography 

The waters of CINP give refuge to an ecologically diverse collection of species assemblages. The park is located at the boundary of two major biogeographical provinces: the Oregonian province to the north and the Californian to the south. The western park islands, San Miguel and Santa Rosa, are bathed by northern waters carried south by the California current and therefore reflect the biological assemblages of the Oregonian province. Waters around the eastern park islands of Anacapa and Santa Barbara come from the south along the mainland coast and support the warm temperate biota characteristic of the Californian province. Around Santa Cruz Island, at the boundary of these two provinces, there is a broad transition zone where plants and animals from both provinces mingle and create a special assemblage of species that are capable of adapting to the unique and variable conditions of the transition zone.

### Upwelling

Prevailing winds and the bathymetry of adjacent basins also greatly influence marine communities in the park. Strong north winds buffet the north sides of the islands, while the biota of the southern coasts reflects their more sheltered location. Upwelling nutrients from 2,000-meter-deep basins to the south and west of the park produce exceptionally productive food webs and temperature regimes that differ significantly from the shallow northern sides of the islands.

### Finding Monitoring Locations

When the sites were selected, detailed benthic habitat maps in areas of persistent kelp were not available for the Channel Islands. Had detailed maps such as these been available, site selection would have been random with the site selection criteria listed below. As a result, sites were chosen by deploying divers on rocky bottom (using an echo sounder) at a selected depth and reeling out a 100-meter tape along the depth contour when possible but also maintaining a consistent heading, usually parallel to shore. If at least 80 meters was over rocky bottom and the reef was at least 100 meters long (rocky on both ends), it was chosen as a site.

### Site Establishment Overview

Since the KFM Program began collecting data in 1982, there have been two main periods during which sites were established in CINP: 1981/82 and 2005. In addition to these two main periods, one additional site was established in CINP at San Miguel Island in 2001 as well as four sites at the US Navy owned, San Clemente Island in 2003. All site selection events are described below.

### Original 16 Sites

The original 16 sites were selected to represent the north and south sides of each of the islands as well as the east-west transition from Californian to Oregonian provinces for long term population monitoring. The sites reflect the broad range of conditions and biological assemblages in the park. Other than the location at the Islands to represent this broad range of conditions, the sites were selected for the presence or known recent presence of kelp forests. The original site selection plan was to select locations meeting the above criteria and then place one deep and one shallow transect at each location.  It was soon realized that logistically the KFM Program could not monitor that many sites and one transect per location was installed. The exception to this is Johnson’s Lee (North and South), Santa Rosa Island, where both a shallow and deep transect were retained. As a result of this original plan of deep and shallow sites, the 16 site depths have a moderately wide range from 4-18 meters.

In August and September 1981, a total of 45 SCUBA divers conducted 643 dives to locate and establish the 13 original 100 m permanent transects. The divers used the NPS vessel Pacific Ranger as a platform of operation. Six week-long cruises were conducted, with eight to ten divers on each cruise. Five biologists from the California Department of Fish and Game assisted the NPS in selecting and establishing the transects. During the remaining cruises, 33 divers from the NPS Western Region dive team and seven scientists from local universities and the National Marine Fisheries Service established the permanent transect lines on the sea floor. Establishment of each transect line consisted of a sequence of operations involving specialized equipment and skills developed specifically for this project (See Data History Section). One additional transect was added in 1983 and two in 1986. These 16 sites established between 1981-1986 are considered the original KFM sites (Table 2). 

### Plus One Site

In 2001, the Miracle Mile site at San Miguel Island was installed. This site was established by Jim Marshall, a commercial abalone and sea urchin fisherman, in conjunction with the County of Santa Barbara and with the assistance of CINP, specifically to monitor the abalone population at this site. Originally, three sites were proposed to better monitor the abalone population at San Miguel Island but only this site was funded. Jim Marshall selected this site based on its exceptionally high density of H. rufescens. We initially observed a decrease in density of H. rufescens following establishment of this site, but density has recently stabilized, maintaining a relatively high density of this species. Following the establishment of a site that was selected for its high abundance of a targeted species, it is not uncommon for a decrease in density such as this to occur. The KFM Program continues to monitor this site as we think more than the original two sites are needed to adequately monitor the kelp forests and abalone at this island.

### Plus 4, Minus 4

In 2003, four KFM sites were established on San Clemente Island in conjunction with the Navy.  The Navy funded the monitoring of these site from 2003-2004. Funding was not available after 2004 and subsequent monitoring has not occurred by NPS.  However, the Navy contracted Tierra Data Systems to conduct monitoring at these sites in 2008-2009. To date, we do not believe monitoring has occurred since. The data collected from 2008-2009 resides with the Navy. Site selection at San Clemente Island was like the regularly monitoring KFM sites. These sites were selected to represent all four sides of San Clemente Island and were chosen at similar depths (9-14 meters) with the criteria of the presence of at least 100 meters of rocky reef with kelp forests.

### Plus 16

In 2005, the park was awarded three years of funding from the NPS Natural Resources Preservation Program (NRPP) to establish baseline ecological conditions of newly established Marine Reserves at the Channel Islands. This project began with the establishment of 16 additional permanent sites. These sites were placed inside or adjacent to the following four newly established Marine reserves: Santa Barbara Island, Anacapa Island, Scorpion Anchorage at Santa Cruz Island, and South Point at Santa Rosa Island. Four of the 11 newly established Marine Reserves were selected because of limited funding and logistics of conducting this type of monitoring. These four Marine Reserves were chosen for all or some of the following reasons: accessibility/logistically feasible to monitor, to make the best use of the KFM Program’s existing base line data from original KFM sites, and fishing impact. New sites were established to complement existing sites so that at least three sites were inside and three adjacent to each of the four chosen Marine Reserves. Site selection was based on choosing locations of similar depths ranging from 8-17 meters, and even distribution of sites inside and directly adjacent to the selected Marine reserves. Following those three years of funding, in 2008, CINP was awarded a Natural Resources Challenge Marine Base increase of $487,000 annually.

### 33 Total

Today, the KFM program monitors 33 sites annually. These are typically monitored between May and October when weather and ocean conditions are the calmest. Divers use a live-aboard dive vessel to visit all sites during 10-11 five day trips. Wich sites get monitored on what trips is largely is decided by the ocean conditions and logistical considerations such as distance and time.

### COVID-19

In 2020, no sites were monitored due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the first insatnce where a site was not monitored in a given survey year. It was decided to not attempt monitoring in order to protect the health and safety of the scientists. The program used this time to revise the monitoring handbook to insure future scientist will have the best resources possible to reference for monitoring.
