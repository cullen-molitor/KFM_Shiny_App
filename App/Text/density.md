## Species Density

Density is a summary statistic which measures the number of individuals per a given area. In ecology, this is generally standardized to the number of individuals per square meter (#/m²). There is no single measure of units which are better than other, but generally people can imagine what a 1 m² box looks like and they so long as they know the usual size of an individual, they can picture how many there are in a given area.
