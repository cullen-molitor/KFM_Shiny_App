## Gini-Simpson Index

We use this index on the KFM percent cover data for 28 taxa (including algae and benthic animals) collected during random point contacts (RPCs). We use a single measure of the Gini-Simpson index because the list of indicator species monitored by RPCs has not changed appreciably since its inception. The few changes which have occurred have been excluded or manipulated to insure backwards compatibility across all years. All substrate is excluded from the data used to calculate this index.
