## Richness

Species richness is the simplest measure of diversity and the least informative. To put it simply, it is the number of species observed. The number observed is limited by the list of indicator species used and therefore is not a true representation of the diversity present. 

The number of species observed is limited by the target list of species. We use two different measures of richness depending on which time range we are discussing. The same list of invertebrates and algae is for both measures. 

From 1982-today, we use Visual Fish Transect (VFT) data which is limited to 13 species. This provides the greatest level of consistency across the full time range of monitoring.

From 1996-today, we instead incorporate Roving Diver Fish Count (RDFC) data which counts all species of fish. 2005 provides a nice cutoff for this summary due to the 16 sites which were added then. 

To provide consistency for these data visualizations, all data summaries except for "MPA Reference Sites" will include the more limited list of fish from VFT. This means that the "MPA Reference Sites" will have higher values and greater variability.
