## Shannon-Wiener Index

The Shannon-Wiener diversity index combines species richness (\# of species) with their relative abundance. Higher numbers correspond to higher diversity. This does not account for the true biodiversity but rather quantifies the relative diversity from a list of indicator species.

We use this index on KFM count data. To get an estimated site level count, we fist calculate a mean density (\#/m²) and multiply by 2,000 m². We use two different measures of the Shannon-Wiener index depending on which time range we are discussing. The same list of invertebrates and algae is for both measures.

From 1982-today, we use Visual Fish Transect (VFT) data which is limited to 13 species. This provides the greatest level of consistency across the full time range of monitoring.

From 1996-today, we instead incorporate Roving Diver Fish Count (RDFC) data which counts all species of fish. 2005 provides a nice cutoff for this summary due to the 16 sites which were added then.

To provide consistency for these data visualizations, all data summaries except for "MPA Reference Sites" will include the more limited list of fish from VFT. This means that the "MPA Reference Sites" have higher number of species used to calculate the index value and will therefore have different values from the other data summaries.
