## Number of Species Present

Species richness is the simplest measure of diversity and the least informative. To put it simply, it is the number of species observed. Used alone, there is not much information to be gleaned from richness. For instance, you can have 991 individuals of one species, and one of 9 additional species to get a richness value of 10. On the other hand if you have 100 individuals of 10 species each, you have a richness value of 10. In both cases there are 1,000 individuals present, and a richness value of 10. Intuitively, we think of the latter situation as being more diverse and the former as less diverse. This is because the latter example is dominated by a single species. In the kelp forest ecosystem, this is the difference between a site dominated by sea urchins, and a healthy kelp forest with a wide array of species in relatively even abundance across all trophic levels.

The number of species observed is usually limited by the target list of species. For the KFMP, we use two different measures of richness depending on how we summarize the data. The same list of invertebrates and algae is for both measures. For fish to be consistent across all years, we must use our Visual Fish Transect (VFT) data which is limited to 13 species. When looking at the MPA reference sites, we instead incorporate Roving Diver Fish Count (RDFC) data which counts all species of fish. We do this because RDFC was implemented in the 1990's and further modified in the early 2000's therefore it cannot be used to count species back to the beginning of monitoring. Since 2004, RDFC has been consistent enough to provide accurate counts for all species of fish which were observed in a given site. 2005 provides a nice cutoff for this summary due to the 16 sites which were added then.

Other measures of diversity take into account species richness but will also account for the relative abundance or dominance of species. The Shannon-Wiener index... The Gini-Simpson...
