# Application Design and Layout

This application is designed as a repository for the methods, locations, and data used and collected by the Kelp Forest Monitoring Program (KFMP) at Channel Islands National Park (CINP). It is meant for basic data visualizations, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ecological modeling. It also includes natural history, marine resource management, and community ecology concepts to illustrate the basic workings of the kelp forest ecosystems present in the near coastal region of California.

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate the main topics. The major topics are:

1.  About - What is KFM?
2.  Species - What do we monitor?
3.  Protocols - How do we conduct monitoring?
4.  Sampling Locations - Where do we conduct monitoring?
5.  Biodiversity - Community diversity over time
6.  Community Similarity - Community similarity over time
7.  Important Species - Classification modeling to identify species which represent communities
8.  Biomass - Density and size frequency are combined to represent estimated biomass
9.  Density - Population density over time
10. Size Frequency - Animal and kelp size frequency distributions over time
11. Reports - Published KFM reports and collaborative works
12. Literature Cited - Literature relevant to kelp forest ecology, meteorology, and oceanography

\* *Within each level of sidebar navigation, there are tabs related to that topic.*

## Data

KFM data can be visualized in many different ways. Typically, data are recapitulated into summary statistics and broken into subsets which are used to visualize focused data.

### KFM summary statistics:

1.  Diversity index values
2.  Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM)
3.  Ranked variable importance
4.  Mean biomass in grams per meter squared (*g/m²*)
5.  Mean density in number of individuals per square meter (*\#/m²*; algae and invertebrates) or number of individuals per cubic meter (*\#/m³*; visual fish transects only)
6.  Biomass or density ratios (inside reserve/outside reserve)
7.  Size frequency distributions and mean sizes
8.  Word/phrase frequency

### Data subsets:

1.  All 33 sites faceted by island with each line representing a site
2.  The original 16 sites grouped by protection status including the old reserve (2 sites), the new reserves (4 sites), and unprotected (10 sites)
3.  The 24 State Marine Reserve (SMR) reference sites (12 sites inside and 12 sites outside)
4.  One of the 33 sites

### Data visualizations:

1.  Time series to see how a variable change over time
2.  Animated time series to see the change over time for many variables, or a single variable at many sites.
3.  Data plotted as a point on a map, with the size of the point scaled to the magnitude of the statistic, and animated over time.
4.  Ranked variables by the relative importance to a model
5.  The partial dependence on a variable relative to a model
6.  Word/phrase frequency cloud
7.  Data tables

### Metadata

When possible, descriptive graphics, text, photos, or metadata will be provided to give context to the data visualizations. Some level of cross referencing with other sections or outside resources may be required to gain perspective.

## Which protocols for which species?

KFM protocols and the list of associated species have changed overtime. These changes were intended to maximize detection power of indicator species while maintaining backwards compatibility. The data summaries here account for these changes and aim to use the "best" possible data for each species in any given survey year. For this reason, certain species will display data from different protocols. *Pisaster giganteus* (giant-spined sea star) is a good example of these changes as they were initially monitored on 1 m² quadrats, but were then added to 5 m² quadrats to increase detection power, and eventually added to band transects after the 2013-14 sea star wasting event.

Below is a summary of the species which are monitored on more than one protocol along with the protocol and year ranges used for these data summaries.

TO DO: put in table of "best"" protocols here
