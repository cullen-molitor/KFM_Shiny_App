## Application Design and Layout

This application is designed as a repository for the methods, locations, and data used and collected by the Kelp Forest Monitoring Program (KFMP) at Channel Islands National Park (CINP). It is meant for basic data visualizations, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ecological modeling. It also includes natural history, marine resource management, and community ecology concepts to illustrate the basic workings of the kelp forest ecosystems present off the coast of California. 

KFM data can be visualized in many different ways. Typically, data is summarized with statistics and subsetted to display focused data. 

#### The four main ways this application subsets data for a single variable are:

1. All 33 sites faceted by island with each line representing a site

2. The original 16 sites grouped by protection status including the old reserve (2 sites), the new reserves (4 sites), and unprotected (10 sites)

3. The 24 State Marine Reserve (SMR) reference sites (12 sites inside and 12 sites outside)

4. One of the 33 sites

#### The data is summarized with several summary statistics including:

1. Diversity index values

2. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM)

3. Mean biomass given in grams per meter squared (g/m²)

4. Mean density given in number of individuals per square meter (#/m²; algae and invertebrates) or number of individuals per cubic meter (#/m³; visual fish transects only)

5. Size frequency distributions and mean sizes

6. Ranked variable importance

7. Word/phrase frequency

#### This application displays data as:

1. Time series to see how a variable change over time

2. Animated time series to see the change over time for many variables, or a single variable at many sites. 

3. Data plotted as a point on a map, with the size of the point scaled to the magnitude of the statistic, and animated over time.

4. Ranked variables by the relative importance to a model

5. The partial dependence on a variable relative to a model.

6. Word/phrase frequency cloud

When possible, descriptive graphics, text, photos, or metadata will be provided to give context to the data visualizations. Some level of cross referencing with other sections or tabs may be required to gain perspective.
