## Application Design and Layout

This application is designed as a repository for the methods, locations, and data used and collected by the Kelp Forest Monitoring Program (KFMP) at Channel Islands National Park (CINP). It is meant for basic data visualizations, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ecological modeling. It also includes natural history, marine resource management, and community ecology concepts to illustrate the basic workings of the kelp forest ecosystems present off the coast of California. 

KFMP data can be summarized and subsetted in many ways to display visualizations. The four main ways this application subsets data are:

1. All 33 sites faceted by island with each line representing a site

2. The original 16 sites grouped by protection status including the old reserve (2 sites), the new reserves (4 sites), and unprotected (10 sites)

3. The 24 State Marine Reserve (SMR) reference sites (12 sites inside and 12 sites outside)

4. A single site of the 33

The data is summarized with several summary statistics including:

1. Diversity index values

2. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM)

3. Mean biomass given in grams per meter squared (g/m²)

4. Mean density given in number of individuals per square meter (#/m²; algae and invertebrates) or number of individuals per cubic meter (#/m³; fish only)

5. Size frequency distributions

When possible, descriptive graphics, text, photos, or metadata will be provided to give context to the data visualizations. Some level of cross referencing other sections, or section tabs, may be required to gain perspective.
