## Background

### The Islands

Kelp forests constitute one of the largest, most complex, and most threatened ecosystems in Channel Islands National Park (CINP). Located at the boundary of two major biogeographical provinces and near unusually persistent upwelling features, the park is endowed with marine ecosystems of exceptional diversity. The five park islands are surrounded by extensive kelp forest habitat with high productivity, which supports large and diverse seabird and pinniped populations. As a result of these conditions and the relative isolation from the mainland, kelp forests in the park are among the best examples of this important ecosystem in southern California.

### The Park

The park boundary extends one nautical mile around each of the five islands, including the waters and submerged lands therein. The living marine resources in the park are managed by the State of California. The National Park Service (NPS), in cooperation with the State of California and the U. S. Department of Commerce, are charged with the responsibility of monitoring the health of park ecosystems and recommending actions to better protect those systems (16 USC 41Off Sec. 203).

### Fisheries

The waters in CINP constitute less than 3% of California's coastal zone, yet they are responsible for about 15% of the State's coastal fishery harvests (CDFG 2004). Despite closed seasons, individual size and bag limits, and restricted uses in some areas, there are virtually no limits on total harvest of fish, lobster, algae, and other marine organisms from park waters. With the impact of harvesting and the threat of chronic and acute pollution from mainland waste disposal and adjacent offshore petroleum development, the potential for major anthropogenic disturbances of these ecosystems is of great concern. Natural disturbances also play an important role in the park, yet very little information on the long-term dynamics of the system is available. Providing the information required to manage these resources effectively is a challenge, but without the knowledge, there is a risk of losing these resources. Managing and conserving kelp forests requires innovative approaches and a better understanding of the ecosystem than currently exists.

### Monitoring Design

The Kelp Forest Monitoring Program (KFMP) is part of the long-term ecological monitoring conducted by the Mediterranean Coast Network (MEDN) of the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program, which is designed to measure the health of the Park's ecosystems. Kelp forests are considered a "Vital Sign" of ecosystem health for CINP (Davis and Halvorson 1988). The objectives of KFM are as follows:

-   Identify trends in ecosystem health

-   Determine limits of variability

-   Diagnose abnormal conditions

-   Suggest potential remedial treatments

### Monitoring Implementation

Following a five-year design study that began in 1982, KFM was fully implemented in 1987 by the park's resource management division using the protocol established during this phase (Davis and Halvorson 1988). Preliminary results and specific design considerations can be found in reports written by Davis (1985, 1986), and the Kelp Forest Monitoring Handbook (Davis et al. 1996) was updated. It is highly recommended or rather essential that new KFM program managers and staff read the other relevant KFM documents to understand the history of monitoring protocols, reviews and changes to the program since 1982.

The KFM began with the establishment of 13 permanent long-term monitoring sites located at the five northernmost Channel Islands. Additional sites were installed in 1983, 1986, 2001 and 2004, and 2005 (see Table 2). In 2005, 16 additional sites were added to assist the State of California in assessing the effectiveness of the newly established Marine Reserves around the Channel Islands. These 16 sites were installed to collect baseline data from areas both inside and adjacent to the Marine Reserves for later evaluation. Since their establishment, each KFM site has been visited at least once every year to collect data on selected species of algae, invertebrates and fish. The KFM now monitors 33 sites annually, providing the longest set of fishery independent data along the west coast.

### Abalone Assessment

In the 1990's, the state of California began using data collected by this program to assist its abalone resource management strategies. Much of the data collected by this program aided in the State's decision to close the pink, green, and white abalone fisheries in 1996, and the red abalone fishery in southern California in 1997. Fisheries were closed to prevent brood stock extinction caused by overharvesting.

### PISCO Partnership

From 2005 to 2007, fish abundance and size monitoring surveys were conducted by University of California Santa Barbara's Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (UCSB/PISCO) under a cooperative agreement at 24 of the monitoring sites, as part of a fine scale Marine Reserve evaluation that was designed by the park. PISCO has published several scientific papers using data collected during this time period.

### KFM Today

Today all 12 KFM monitoring protocols are conducted at all 33 permanent sites each year. The 2020 monitoring season was canceled due to concerns over the global COVID-19 pandemic. This was the first instance of missing a monitoring site in 38 years.
