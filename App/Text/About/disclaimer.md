## Unofficial

This web application is to be used for data exploration and visualization purposes only. The raw data has been checked and certified by the resident subtidal marine ecologist for Channel Islands National Park. The summary tables used for many of the visualizations were produced independently and have not been peer reviewed or verified for accuracy. The graphics produced here are not intended for publication and everything shown is assumed to be suspect without further analysis. For official data requests, please submit an [application](https://irma.nps.gov/RPRS/) or contact Channel Islands National Park's [marine ecologist](https://www.nps.gov/im/medn/kelp-forest-communities.htm) with further questions. 

**This application is not paid for by the National Park Service, nor is it endorsed by them in any way.**

## Patience Required

This application is hosted on a free google cloud service with minimal resources allocated. Many of the features of this app may load slowly. Some features require significant computation to plot and will load even slower than others. 

## Incomplete

This application is under development and as such many of the features are incomplete. If you click on something that is empty, it is likely a placeholder for something to come in the future. I have tried to leave coming soon messages in many of these places but there are still some fully blank. Many tabs are incomplete and the layout is still being finalized. I am not a graphic designer and I have trouble balancing functionality with appearance.
