### General

The design of this ecological monitoring program was supported by the National Park Service in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Game, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Sanctuary Program. Of particular note were the sustained efforts of G. E. Davis, D. V. Richards, D. J. Kushner, J. M Morgan, J. E. Mondragon, D. Lerma, M. D. Moss, K. J. Moore, J. M. Engle, M. D. Conlin, T. J. Herrlinger, T. W. Anderson, J. D. Lewis, D. C. Canestro, S. L. Kim, D. Forcucci, and J. W. Trone. Their broad experience greatly strengthened the experimental design and resulting monitoring protocols. Since the inception of KFM, more than 430 scientists, resource managers and boat captains from many academic institutions and resource management agencies participated in this endeavor.

### Funding

Funding for the kelp forest monitoring program has been almost entirely provided by the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) with most funding coming from the Stewardship of New Marine Protected Areas and some from the Inventory and Monitoring Program.

In 2001, the site Miracle Mile at San Miguel Island was installed. This site was established by Jim Marshall, a commercial abalone and sea urchin fisherman, in conjunction with the County of Santa Barbara and with the assistance of CINP, specifically to monitor the high density abalone population present. Originally, three sites were proposed to better monitor the abalone population at San Miguel Island but only this site was funded. The KFM Program continues to monitor this site as we think more than the original two sites are needed to adequately monitor the kelp forests and abalone at this island.

In 2003, four KFM sites were established on San Clemente Island in conjunction with the Navy. The Navy funded the monitoring of these site from 2003-2004. Funding was not available after 2004 and subsequent monitoring has not occurred by NPS.

In 2005, the park was awarded three years of funding from the NPS Natural Resources Preservation Program (NRPP) to establish baseline ecological conditions of newly established Marine Reserves at the Channel Islands. Following those three years of funding, in 2008, CINP was awarded a Natural Resources Challenge Marine Base increase of \$487,000 annually.

### Permanent Staff

Permanent staff members provide a source of institutional knowledge and insure the smooth operation and continuation of the KFM Program. Their knowledge is constantly being added to the monitoring handbook in an attempt to capture the quarks of the program and to simplify the the program for future teams. This is an impossible task, and the KFM Program has benefited greatly from dedicated full time permanent staff to carry this knowledge and pass it to the next generation of staff.

### Boat Captains

The CINP transportation division provides full time boat captains to assist and participate in monitoring efforts. These captains are essential to providing a suitable diving and living platform for the scientists to conduct monitoring from. Of particular note are the captains Diane Brooks and Keith Duran who have provided this essential service for the majority of the programs long history.

### Seasonal Staff

Currently the KFM Program relies heavily on hiring 4 to 6 seasonal biological science technicians for each years survey season. These divers make up the bulk of the 430 scientists who have participated in the monitoring effort. Monitoring would not be possible without the help of these employees.

Prior to seasonal biological science technicians, KFM relied on... (Ask David for details on how staff were previously hired, maybe something about star interns? not really sure)

Additionally, we want to thank D. G. Baldwin, L. E. Cullen, T. I. McClure, C. D. Molitor, and L. J. Montgomery for their contributions for their assistance with publishing the third revision of the KFM Handbook.

### Volunteers

Volunteer divers have provided an essential role in the KFM Program. One to two volunteer divers are typically recruited for each 5 day survey trip. These divers are typically from partner organizations such as CDFW, NOAA, the Bay Foundation, or university dive programs.

Sometimes volunteers are also recruited from other National Parks or from other positions within Channel Islands National Park. They are viewed as volunteers simply because KFM is not directly related to their official duties. These divers are usually from other dive programs and come as fully trained divers.

### Education and Interpretation Rangers

The KFM Program is much better suited to field biology and data analysis and therefore relies heavily on others for education and outreach. This work is vital to relaying the results of monitoring to the public and to classrooms. Half of Channel Islands National Park is underwater, and it is important to share this portion of the park with those who may not be able to enjoy it otherwise.

Education and Interpretation Rangers at Channel Islands National Park are essential to meeting this goal. This includes activities scheduled at the [Robert J. Lagomarsino Visitor Center in Ventura Harbor, CA](https://goo.gl/maps/8iACeF7yixdJjDYg8), visits to local classrooms, and answering questions and calls on a daily basis.

One of the most important educational programs at CINP is [Channel Islands Live](https://www.nps.gov/chis/planyourvisit/channel-islands-live-nps.htm) which includes interactive broadcasts where visitors can talk to the rangers and ask questions, curriculum-based presentations for schools, and webcams for monitoring island and underwater features. Park visitors and students can join us for these programs on Anacapa Island, at the Visitor Center in Ventura Harbor, in classrooms, and on the Internet.

Finally it is my hope that this application will help to spread knowledge of kelp forest ecology and the long term monitoring efforts of CINP.
