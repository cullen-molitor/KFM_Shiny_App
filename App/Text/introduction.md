## **Application Design and Layout**

This application is designed as a repository for the methods, locations, and data used and collected by the Kelp Forest Monitoring Program (KFMP) at Channel Islands National Park (CINP). It is meant for basic data visualizations, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ecological modeling. It also includes natural history, marine resource management, and community ecology concepts to illustrate the basic workings of the kelp forest ecosystems present off the coast of California.
